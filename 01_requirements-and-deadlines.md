# CAPSTONE REQUIREMENTS AND DEADLINES

### REQUIREMENTS
##### Technical Requirements:
* React
* Firebase CRUD
* Bootstrap
* It is NOT required to use an external API.

##### Planning:
* Use Github Projects for planning
* Create wireframes (use whatever tool you want - moqups, lucid charts, photoshop, adobe XD, etc.)
* If you are using an external API, gather all sample data and be prepared to demo your api at your first checkin (via axios call - use the first react project we made) before committing to use the API.
* If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your capstone mentor will not let you code.

##### Project NoNos:
* Projects shouldn't be something for your day job
* Projects shouldn't be for someone who will pay you :moneybag:.
* No MVP can include a calendar
* No apps that require use of the spotify API.
* No recipe apps of ANY kind - they have all been done, they all look the same, there are no good free APIs.
* No games - there isn't enough time to make games for you capstone.  Feel free to do one or 12 as a side project
