* It is NOT required to use an external API.

##### Planning:
* Use Github Projects for planning
* Create wireframes (use whatever tool you want - moqups, lucid charts, photoshop, adobe XD, Figma, etc.)
* If you are using an external API, gather all sample data and be prepared to demo your api at your first checkin (via Postman) before committing to use the API.
* If you have not fleshed out your planning enough, your capstone mentor will not let you code.

##### Documentation:
* A completed README with details and deployment link. [Remember our planning from the beginning of the cohort.](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-13/team-planning#readme-is-completed-with)

##### Project NoNos:
* Projects shouldn't be something for your day job
* Projects shouldn't be for someone who will pay you :moneybag:.
* No MVP can include a calendar
* No apps that require use of the spotify API.
* No recipe apps of ANY kind - they have all been done, they all look the same, there are no good free APIs.
* No games - there isn't enough time to make games for your capstone.  Feel free to do one or 12 as a side project
* No game tracking applications - ie dashboards for DnD, WoW, etc
* No projects that are super similar to things we have done in class
