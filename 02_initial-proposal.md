:star2::star2::star2::star2:[SUBMIT PROPOSAL HERE](https://forms.gle/CNyaAx3DgXBhXot58):star2::star2::star2::star2:


#### Your initial proposal is needed to
1. Match you with a capstone mentor.
1. Get your project approved by Dr. T.
1. Establish the reason why you want to build your capstone, projects of passion are the best projects.
1. Establish the scope of the application you want to build.

#### What goes in your initial proposal?
1. The working title of your application
1. Paragraph explaining your application and how it will work
1. Paragraph talking about your motivation for building this project (what problem does it solve, why are you personally invested in this).
1. Paragraph talking about the rough features you want to build (and identify whether you think each is a stretch or not).

#### An Indecent Proposal

###### Match.dog
This app is to match users with the dog of their choice. People will give some information that will go through a bunch of dogs and match them with the one that is best for them. I am thinking about using an API but I can't find one that has all of my data yet. I really like dogs and I like it when people adopt dogs, so I want to make sure they are getting the right dog. I want to learn CRUD and React. People will be able to be able create accounts, save dogs to their account, and delete the dogs from their account.


#### A Decent Proposal

###### Boogie and Brush
An Oral Hygiene Promotion App for children.

I plan to build an application to motivate children to brush for a full 2 minutes. The primary user of the application will be children, the secondary user will be parents. When a child logs in to the app, they will be prompted to either see their brushing records or to "brush their teeth now." When they opt to "brush now", they will be guided to a page where they can pick four 30-second song clips from a list. Once they pick these, it will play an animation video (and background music they just selected). Once the video is finished playing, they receive a sticker for completing brushing. If the video is exited before 2 minutes, they will not receive the sticker.

The need for this app became clear when the following statistic came across my desk: children only brush their teeth 6 times a week. Because they are not germ-a-phobes (and maybe not even hygenic), they don't know the health benefits of brushing your teeth, so they need a little external nudge. There are plenty of reward systems out there, but a digital one will allow the parents to be a bit less helecopter-y.

Personally, I want to use this application to practice/emphasize/show-off 2 skills: flat data structure and understanding of two-way binding with Angular. I feel like I have been getting away with "squishing" my data and need more practice with using foreign keys. This project would have 3 collections that all relate to one another, so loads of data. I plan to have as few screens as possible, so the application is going to have tons of events, which is going to mean tons of binding.

Features:
> Parents must create an account for access to the app.

> Child users log in each time they intend to brush their teeth. They can either view their previous brushing records or create a new brushing record.

> If child user opts to create a new brushing record, they are able to select 4 clips from a set of "mystery songs" to compile one 2-minute song. Once they have 4 selections, they are able to play their "custom" song.

> While the child user's "custom" song is playing, they receive step-by-step brushing instructions from an animated slideshow.

> Once the 2-minute animation and song duo is completed. The child receives a "sticker" for brushing. Brushing is limited to once per morning and once per evening.

> Once per week, the parents will be emailed with the results of how many times their child(ren) brushed that week. (STRETCH)
